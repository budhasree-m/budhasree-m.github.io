  <h1>Self-Directed Learning Readiness Assessment</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    This readiness assessment is to try to identify learner's levels of self-directedness in learning in higher education, especially for adults. Please read and choose the most appropriate response for each statement indicating the level at which you rate yourself. 
	Please note that your first reaction to every statement is the most accurate response; therefore, do not spend too long to respond.<br><br>
   <!-- The 'any other' space is provided for you to add any other issues about self-directedness in learning you think relevant. A 'scoring sheet' is included for you to assess the level of your self-directedness in learning.-->
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>Likert Scale:</strong> <br><br>
	5 = Always, 4 = Often, 3 = Sometimes, 2 = Seldom, 1 = Never
  </div>

   <form id="surveyForm">
    <!-- Questions inserted dynamically here -->
  </form>

  <div class="suggestions" id="suggestions"></div>
  
  <div class="note">
    ðŸ’¡ <strong>Important:</strong> This assessment is for your personal growth. The scores â€” Low, Moderate, and High â€” are not to be viewed as a hierarchy but as helpful categories. Everyone learns differently, and we all need different kinds of support to grow. If you score Low, mentorship alone may not help â€” instead, you may need deeply personalized support and redesigned learning environments. Inclusion, context, and compassion matter more than competition.
